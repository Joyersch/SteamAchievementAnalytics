# About
This tool is suppose to help with choosing the easiest game to complete to bump the average game completion. 
# Important
This tool is only able to read the games you have from the steam api.  
If you're profile is private the api does not return any games.  
If you have returned a game, the api will not return that game.    
But steam will still track that game as started.  
Therefor the calculated Completion % will be of.
